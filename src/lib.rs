/**
An opaque buffer type.

# Design

Imagine the OS implements reasonable syscalls like `read` by passing you a pointer into
kernel memory.  You can read the memory, but you can't write it, but you do need to free it.

You can copy it into a vec or something and free it straightaway, but the copy may be undesireable.

For reading we can import into Rust as a slice.  But for freeing we need a custom Drop implementation,
and we can't Drop a reference; that has no effect.

So here's an opaque type that can be bridged to the slice but may have a custom Drop implementation.
To bridge to slice, use `as_ref` or `deref`.  To bridge to a `Box<[u8]>`, use `into_boxed_slice`.

    On platforms where it is sensible, this is a zero-cost operation.

    Some differences from `fs` are:

         Imagine that you start a read operation.  After starting it, you cancel the operation (drop a future).

boilerplates.

Data - OS probably supports a clone op via refcount, but i think we don't want to expose it â€“ use rc/arc if you want that.
PartialEq and Eq are at least possible to implement via slice
Ord does not make a ton of sense to me

Hash is possible...
No to default/display
Send/sync ought to be possible, since it's immutable
unpin - should be safe to unpin, even if it seems to have an internal pointer somewhere.

fs does not have a clone op, so we don't either

No asref/asmut, as we don't want to expose internals

Files ought to be send at least.  Probably sync as well, although we don't expose many immutable methods.
I think we don't expect the OS to have pointers into them, so unpin should be safe.

Metadata
std derives Clone but not Copy
